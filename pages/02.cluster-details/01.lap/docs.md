_\*Learning Resources - to enable learners to meet the requirements of this unit of competency or cluster._

**Reasonable Adjustment**

We recognise that every student has different learning styles and needs. Please let your lecturer know if there is anything that may have an effect on your learning so they may be able to adjust your plan.

## Results and Appeals

Students may lodge an appeal against an academic result. Appeals must be lodged within four weeks of the date of your statement of academic record being issued.  Please contact the Student Experience Team relevant to your portfolio area.

## Absences

If you are unable to attend any class or assessment session you must inform your lecturer as soon as possible.

If you miss an assessment due to illness, please provide your lecturer with a medical certificate in order to negotiate an alternate time for the assessment.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is using another person&#39;s ideas and words without clearly acknowledging the source of the information. It is not acceptable to submit an assessment that is based on another person&#39;s work and claim it as your own. If you submit an assessment that is significantly or recognizably the same or similar in content as submitted by another student (current or past) you may have to submit another assessment.

## Assessment Resit/Resubmission

You shall be permitted to have at least two attempts to demonstrate competency against a unit of competency or cluster of units of competency.

To qualify for re-assessment:

- you must have made a reasonable attempt to complete the assessment satisfactorily

AND

- you must have submitted the original assessment by the due date

OR

- you must have attended and participated in the original assessment event

In the case of a re-assessment opportunity, your lecturer will give you a due date for your second attempt. Should you not achieve a Satisfactory result on the second attempt, you will need to re-enrol (R) in the unit.

In certain situations a re-assessment is not possible; please refer to your assessment instructions.
